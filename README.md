Description
This is a Spring Boot Java program I developed for the middle-tier of my project. It communicates between the SQL database backend and the 
Android Application front-end to provide various functionality for the system.

It also communicates with the Path Adder tool for the user to sign in function. It provides a JSON list of cameras objects belonging to the
user account, which the Path Adder uses to form the path entries for the YML file.
